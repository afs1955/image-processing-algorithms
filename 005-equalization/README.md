# Image Equalization

This code takes an image and performs its equalization with two auxiliary arrays and also outputs an histogram that counts how many times a pixel value is repeated in the image, before and after equalization. <br />

# Output

Equalization is especially useful when having a darkened or extremely lighted image. The image used was the following. <br />

This image has an histogram of values as follows. <br />

The equalized image is the one below. <br />

And this, too, created a value histogram which shows how the equalization *expanded* the values. <br />
